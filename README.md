Custom Proof of Stake Blockchain
This repository contains the implementation of a custom Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, including integration with MetaMask, starting a node and its APIs, and writing and deploying smart contracts to the blockchain.

Overview
The custom PoS blockchain consists of the following components:

PoS consensus mechanism
Node and P2P communication
JSON-RPC API
Smart contract support with Solidity
Integration with MetaMask
To add the custom PoS blockchain to MetaMask, follow these steps:

Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown (usually shows "Ethereum Mainnet").
Scroll down and click on "Custom RPC".
Fill in the following details:
Network Name: Enter a name for your custom PoS blockchain.
New RPC URL: Enter the URL of the JSON-RPC server (e.g., http://localhost:3000/jsonrpc).
Chain ID: Provide a unique Chain ID for your network.
Currency Symbol (optional): Enter the symbol of the native cryptocurrency.
Block Explorer URL (optional): If available, provide the URL of the block explorer for your blockchain.
Click "Save" to add the custom PoS blockchain to MetaMask.
Now you can interact with the custom PoS blockchain using MetaMask.

Starting a Node and its APIs
To start a node, you'll first need to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Then, run the following command to start the node:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command starts both the P2P node and the JSON-RPC server. The P2P node listens for incoming connections and handles message broadcasting, while the JSON-RPC server exposes the API for interacting with the blockchain.

The JSON-RPC API supports the following methods:

getLatestBlock: Returns the latest block in the blockchain.
addTransaction: Adds a transaction to the blockchain.
You can extend the API with additional methods as needed for your specific use case.

Writing and Deploying Smart Contracts
To write a smart contract, you'll need to use the Solidity programming language. A simple example of a smart contract is as follows:

solidity
Copy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
To deploy the smart contract to the custom PoS blockchain, follow these steps:

Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler, solc. This will generate a JSON file containing the contract's bytecode and ABI (Application Binary Interface).
Use a tool like Truffle or Hardhat to deploy the smart contract to the custom PoS blockchain.
Configure the deployment tool to use the JSON-RPC URL of your blockchain (e.g., http://localhost:3000/jsonrpc).
Specify the private key of the account that will deploy the smart contract.
Create a deployment script to deploy the smart contract using the bytecode and ABI generated in step 1.
Run the deployment script to deploy the smart contract to the custom PoS blockchain
